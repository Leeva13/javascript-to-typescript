### Description of interactivity

1. modal windows:**.

   - Dropdown on the navigation bar:** When you hover the mouse over the items with a dropdown menu (on large screens), the dropdown menu is displayed.

7. **Testimonials Carousel:**
- Testimonials Carousel:** Testimonials are displayed in a carousel that automatically scrolls at a reasonable speed and adapts to different screen sizes.

### **Technologies and Libraries**.

- TypeScript:** Used to write code with typing, which improves the quality and reliability of the code.
- jQuery:** For easy DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Bootstrap:** For styling and interface components.
- Owl Carousel:** For creating a carousel of reviews.
- Counter-Up:** For animating counters.
