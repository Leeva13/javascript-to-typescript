# University Schedule Management System

This project is an implementation of a University Schedule Management System using JavaScript and TypeScript. The system allows users to manage and organize university schedules by adding, modifying, and canceling lessons, as well as analyzing classroom utilization and detecting schedule conflicts.

## Key Features:
- Add, update, and cancel lessons for different professors and courses.
- Search for available classrooms based on the day of the week and time slots.
- Check for scheduling conflicts to ensure no overlapping lessons.
- Analyze classroom utilization rates.
- Generate reports on the most popular course types.

## Technologies:
- **TypeScript**: Used for strong typing and error checking.
- **JavaScript**: Used for dynamic functionality and DOM manipulation.

### Files:
- `script.js`: Contains the core logic in JavaScript.
- `script.ts`: TypeScript version of the code with types and additional validation.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
